What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
- JavaScript is quite a simple language as it combine many aspects of other programming languages and compresses them into just a few, for example is the var, let, and const, rather than the large array of data types used in other languages. I would say that this makes it easier to code in but it may lead to problems such as making it harder to read due to lack of specific data types.
